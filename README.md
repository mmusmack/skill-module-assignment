# skill-module-assignment
A simple example project to demonstrate Git skillset.

This project is a simple text-based UI framework that could be used to construct various displays from row's and columns. In conjuction with this, a simple GUI is constructed with basic interactions defined by the UI to emulate the beginning of a "clicker" type of game.

The main purpose is to demonstrate the use of more advanced git techniques such as branching frameworks, consise commits, and the use of staging.


A branch will be created for in-progress code, first draft code, and finalized code.

In-Progress code may be partially functioning code building one method at a time. Pull requests must be made to move from In-Progress to Draft code.
Draft code is functioning, albiet not necissarily fully documented code. It brings methods together to create one fully finished feature but might have bugs.
Finalized code is code documented with a comment for each method and tested to ensure proper functionality.
